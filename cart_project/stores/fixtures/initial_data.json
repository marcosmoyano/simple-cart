        "description": "With the newly developed Advanced Multi-CAM 3500DX autofocus sensor module, the densely located 51 focus points, supported by an algorithm equivalent to that of the D4, deliver amazing capturing power. AF detection is available down to an impressive -2 EV (ISO 100, 20\u00b0C/68\u00b0F), which is the brightness equivalent to a subject illuminated by moonlight.\r\nFifteen cross-type sensors cover the most frequently used center area. The center point performs as a cross-type sensor even at f/8. This enables AF shooting, with the effective aperture value slower than f/5.6 and faster than f/8 or at f/8 when an AF-S teleconverter is attached to the lens. For example, accurate autofocus is possible with the effective aperture value of f/8 by attaching a 2.0x teleconverter to a telephoto lens with maximum aperture of f/4. By combining a teleconverter with compact and lightweight DX-format system, you can enjoy supertelephoto AF shooting without bulky equipment and expand the photographic opportunities.\r\nFurthermore, when the image area of 1.3x crop of DX is selected, the angle of view becomes equivalent to that of a lens with about double the focal length in 35mm format. As the cropped frame is almost entirely covered by the focus points, the camera demonstrates even more powerful capturing capability.",

Combined with the sharp depiction of NIKKOR lenses, the high resolution renders details of the subject minutely and delivers images with great definition and depth. The sensor also supports wide ISO sensitivity range, high-speed readout during live view and Full HD movie recording.\r\nThe D5200 comes equipped with image-processing engine EXPEED 3, equivalent to that of higher-end models such as the D4. It processes multiple tasks in parallel at high speed while maintaining high precision to bring out the full potential of the 24.1 megapixels for both still images and movies. The image processing of the EXPEED 3 is excellent at color reproduction, gradation processing and image quality at high sensitivity. It reproduces human skin tone, eyelashes and hair more faithfully. Furthermore, from image processing and card recording to image playback and image transfer, EXPEED 3 manages massive amounts of data at high speed. Even with high ISO noise reduction and Active D-Lighting, continuous shooting speed is not sacrificed, realizing comfortable shooting. This also contributes to energy saving.",

It achieves high-resolution rendering and rich tonal gradation that smoothly reproduces human skin texture and gradation of sky. Also, utilizing the large sensor of a D-SLR, high-quality still images and movies can be taken with beautiful background blur. The high pixel count of the D3200 is also effective when images are printed. Even when taken still images are trimmed and enlarged, high-resolution image quality is realized with the least degradation.\r\nTo process 24.2-megapixel data at high speed, an image-processing engine EXPEED 3, the same as that used by the Nikon D4, that is optimized for D-SLRs is incorporated. EXPEED 3 realizes faithful reproduction of human skin, expanded dynamic range and improved color rendering in Active D-Lighting. With its high-performance noise-reduction function, rich gradation with less noise is achieved even at a high sensitivity range, for both still images and movies.\r\nAlso, with high-speed readout from the image sensor integrated with superior image-processing capability, Full HD D-Movie at 1,920 x 1,080/30p is supported.\r\n",
